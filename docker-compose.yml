      - "3000:3000" # Map host port 3000 to container port 3000
    environment:

      SERVER_PORT: "3000"    # Explicitly set port, though default is 3000

    # Optional: If you want to bind-mount for development (less common with multi-stage builds for simplicity)
    # volumes:
    #   - ./src:/app/src # Mount Rust source for dev (requires recompilation in container)
    #   - ./frontend/src:/app/frontend/src # Mount TS source for dev (requires recompilation)
    #   - ./public:/app/public # Mount public for dev (requires build step outside container)
    # If using volumes, you'd typically remove the COPY commands for those directories in the Dockerfile
    # and run the build steps on the host. But for a clean production build, the current Dockerfile is better.
